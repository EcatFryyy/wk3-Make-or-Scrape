On average, people pick up their smartphones around 58 times per day according to a 2021 study by Asurion. However, it is very usual that young adults between the ages of 18-25 have 5-6 hours of sleep every day. In this week's practice, I'm trying to collect the number of times that I pick up my phone, the length of sleep I got, my average screen time and times spent on social media every day and will try to implement them into visual art next week.
The final result will be like 4 clocks that are ticking based on all the data I got from time monitoring apps and self-aware, the longer the time the faster it ticks, since a human only got 24 hours per day. 
The final work will be like a part of the image below, reference from‘A MILLION TIMES’ BY HUMANS SINCE 1982.
